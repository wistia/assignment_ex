defmodule Assignment.Result do
  @moduledoc """
  Data structure returned after assignments occur

  ## Fields

  * `assignments` - a map of destinations to input assigned to those destinations

  * `destinations` - all of the destinations provided

  * `unassigned` - input we wanted to assign but that didn't get assigned (e.g. configured not to loop)

  * `state` - allows for assignment to be continued from where it left off. This allows us to do things like ensure
      we round-robin fairly between desintations over multiple calls
